# Meatless

A native app to help people find meatless dishes at restaurants. It was my first time working with web scraping, natural language processing, MongoDB, Figma components, and Flutter, so I definitely learned a lot. For a full walkthrough of the project, visit http://www.carolynwang.com/meatless/!
